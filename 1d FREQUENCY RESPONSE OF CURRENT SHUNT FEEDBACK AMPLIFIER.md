### **Result**

Thus the current shunt feedback amplifier is designed and constructed  and the following parameters are calculated.
| S.No | Parameters | Without Feedback | With Feedback |
|:----:|-------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Lower cut-off frequency | f1=470Hz | f1"=430Hz |
| 2 | Upper cut-off frequency | f2=220khz | f2"=1.1Mhz |
| 3 | Bandwidth | \( BW = fh - fl = 219.53khz) | \( BW = f'h - f'l = 1.09Mhz) |
| 4 | Mid-band Gain | \( A{v(mid)} = 8.40\) | \( A'{v(mid)} = 3.35\) |
| 5 | Gain at half power point | 5.93 | 2.36 | 

---

**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the current shunt feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
